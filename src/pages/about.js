                there is no way a bee
                should be able to fly.
                <br />
                Its wings are too small to get
                its fat little body off the ground.
                <br />
                The bee, of course, flies anyway
                <br />
                because bees don't care
                what humans think is impossible.

                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                <br />
                Ooh, black and yellow!
                Let's shake it up a little.
                <br />
                Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                <br />
                Ooming!
                <br />
                Hang on a second.
                <br />
                Hello?
                <br />
                - Barry?
                - Adam?
                <br />
                - Oan you believe this is happening?
                - I can't. I'll pick you up.
                <br />
                Looking sharp.
                <br />
                Use the stairs. Your father
                paid good money for those.
                <br />
                Sorry. I'm excited.
                <br />
                Here's the graduate.
                We're very proud of you, son.
                <br />
                A perfect report card, all B's.
                <br />
                Very proud.
                <br />
                Ma! I got a thing going here.
                <br />
                - You got lint on your fuzz.
                - Ow! That's me!
                <br />
                - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                - Bye!
                <br />
                Barry, I told you,
                stop flying in the house!
                <br />
                - Hey, Adam.
                - Hey, Barry.
                <br />
                - Is that fuzz gel?
                - A little. Special day, graduation.
                <br />
                Never thought I'd make it.
                <br />
                Three days grade school,
                three days high school.
                <br />
                Those were awkward.
                <br />
                Three days college. I'm glad I took
                a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
                <br />
                You did come back different.
                <br />
                - Hi, Barry.
                - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
                <br />
                - Hear about Frankie?
                - Yeah.
                <br />
                - You going to the funeral?
                - No, I'm not going.
                <br />
                Everybody knows,
                sting someone, you die.
                <br />
                Don't waste it on a squirrel.
                Such a hothead.
                <br />
                I guess he could have
                just gotten out of the way.
                <br />
                I love this incorporating
                an amusement park into our day.
                <br />
                That's why we don't need vacations.
                <br />
                Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
                under the circumstances.
                <br />
                - Well, Adam, today we are men.
                - We are!
                <br />
                - Bee-men.
                - Amen!
                <br />
                Hallelujah!
                <br />
                Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
                <br />
                please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
                <br />
                Welcome, New Hive Oity
                graduating class of...
                <br />
                ...9:15.
                <br />
                That concludes our ceremonies.
                <br />
                And begins your career
                at Honex Industries!
                <br />
                Will we pick ourjob today?
                <br />
                I heard it's just orientation.
                <br />
                Heads up! Here we go.
                <br />
                Keep your hands and antennas
                inside the tram at all times.
                <br />
                - Wonder what it'll be like?
                - A little scary.
                <br />
                Welcome to Honex,
                a division of Honesco
                <br />
                and a part of the Hexagon Group.
                <br />
                This is it!
                <br />
                Wow.
                <br />
                Wow.
                <br />
                We know that you, as a bee,
                have worked your whole life
                <br />
                to get to the point where you
                can work for your whole life.
                <br />
                Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
                Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
                <br />
                Our top-secret formula
                <br />
                is automatically color-corrected,
                scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
                <br />
                into this soothing sweet syrup
                <br />
                with its distinctive
                golden glow you know as...
                <br />
                Honey!
                <br />
                - That girl was hot.
                - She's my cousin!
                <br />
                - She is?
                - Yes, we're all cousins.
                <br />
                - Right. You're right.
                - At Honex, we constantly strive
                <br />
                to improve every aspect
                of bee existence.
                <br />
                These bees are stress-testing
                a new helmet technology.
                <br />
                - What do you think he makes?
                - Not enough.
                <br />
                Here we have our latest advancement,
                the Krelman.
                <br />
                - What does that do?
                - Oatches that little strand of honey
                <br />
                that hangs after you pour it.
                Saves us millions.
                <br />
                Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
                <br />
                Of course. Most bee jobs are
                small ones. But bees know
                <br />
                that every small job,
                if it's done well, means a lot.
                <br />
                But choose carefully
                <br />
                because you'll stay in the job
                you pick for the rest of your life.
                <br />
                The same job the rest of your life?
                I didn't know that.
                <br />
                What's the difference?
                <br />
                You'll be happy to know that bees,
                as a species, haven't had one day off
                <br />
                in 27 million years.
                <br />
                So you'll just work us to death?
                <br />
                We'll sure try.
                <br />
                Wow! That blew my mind!
                <br />
                "What's the difference?"
                How can you say that?
                <br />
                One job forever?
                That's an insane choice to have to make.
                <br />
                I'm relieved. Now we only have
                to make one decision in life.
                <br />
                But, Adam, how could they
                never have told us that?
                <br />
                Why would you question anything?
                We're bees.
                <br />
                We're the most perfectly
                functioning society on Earth.
                <br />
                You ever think maybe things
                work a little too well here?
                <br />
                Like what? Give me one example.
                <br />
                I don't know. But you know
                what I'm talking about.
                <br />
                Please clear the gate.
                Royal Nectar Force on approach.
                <br />
                Wait a second. Oheck it out.
                <br />
                - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
                - Wow.
                <br />
                I've never seen them this close.
                <br />
                They know what it's like
                outside the hive.
                <br />
                Yeah, but some don't come back.
                <br />
                - Hey, Jocks!
                - Hi, Jocks!
                <br />
                You guys did great!
                <br />
                You're monsters!
                You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
                <br />
                - I wonder where they were.
                - I don't know.
                <br />
                Their day's not planned.
                <br />
                Outside the hive, flying who knows
                where, doing who knows what.
                <br />
                You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
                Jock. You have to be bred for that.
                <br />
                Right.
                <br />
                Look. That's more pollen
                than you and I will see in a lifetime.
                <br />
                It's just a status symbol.
                Bees make too much of it.
                <br />
                Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
                and the ladies see you wearing it.
                <br />
                Those ladies?
                Aren't they our cousins too?
                <br />
                Distant. Distant.
                <br />
                Look at these two.
                <br />
                - Oouple of Hive Harrys.
                - Let's have fun with them.
                <br />
                It must be dangerous
                being a Pollen Jock.
                <br />
                Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
                against a mushroom!
                <br />
                He had a paw on my throat,
                and with the other, he was slapping me!
                <br />
                - Oh, my!
                - I never thought I'd knock him out.
                <br />
                What were you doing during this?
                <br />
                Trying to alert the authorities.
                <br />
                I can autograph that.
                <br />
                A little gusty out there today,
                wasn't it, comrades?
                <br />
                Yeah. Gusty.
                <br />
                We're hitting a sunflower patch
                six miles from here tomorrow.
                <br />
                - Six miles, huh?
                - Barry!
                <br />
                A puddle jump for us,
                but maybe you're not up for it.
                <br />
                - Maybe I am.
                - You are not!
                <br />
                We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
                <br />
                What do you think, buzzy-boy?
                Are you bee enough?
                <br />
                I might be. It all depends
                on what 0900 means.
                <br />
                Hey, Honex!
                <br />
                Dad, you surprised me.
                <br />
                You decide what you're interested in?
                <br />
                - Well, there's a lot of choices.
                - But you only get one.
                <br />
                Do you ever get bored
                doing the same job every day?
                <br />
                Son, let me tell you about stirring.
                <br />
                You grab that stick, and you just
                move it around, and you stir it around.
                <br />
                You get yourself into a rhythm.
                It's a beautiful thing.
                <br />
                You know, Dad,
                the more I think about it,
                <br />
                maybe the honey field
                just isn't right for me.
                <br />
                You were thinking of what,
                making balloon animals?
                <br />
                That's a bad job
                for a guy with a stinger.
                <br />
                Janet, your son's not sure
                he wants to go into honey!
                <br />
                - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
                - I'm not trying to be funny.
                <br />
                You're not funny! You're going
                into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
                <br />
                - You're gonna be a stirrer?
                - No one's listening to me!
                <br />
                Wait till you see the sticks I have.
                <br />
                I could say anything right now.
                I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
                <br />
                Let's open some honey and celebrate!
                <br />
                Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
                Shave my antennae.
                <br />
                Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
                a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
                <br />
                I'm so proud.
                <br />
                - We're starting work today!
                - Today's the day.
                <br />
                Oome on! All the good jobs
                will be gone.
                <br />
                Yeah, right.
                <br />
                Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
                stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
                <br />
                - Is it still available?
                - Hang on. Two left!
                <br />
                One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
                Step to the side.
                <br />
                - What'd you get?
                - Picking crud out. Stellar!
                <br />
                Wow!
                <br />
                Oouple of newbies?
                <br />
                Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
                <br />
                Make your choice.
                <br />
                - You want to go first?
                - No, you go.
                <br />
                Oh, my. What's available?
                <br />
                Restroom attendant's open,
                not for the reason you think.
                <br />
                - Any chance of getting the Krelman?
                - Sure, you're on.
                <br />
                I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
                <br />
                Wax monkey's always open.
                <br />
                The Krelman opened up again.
                <br />
                What happened?
                <br />
                A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
                He's dead. Another dead one.
                <br />
                Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
                <br />
                Dead from the neck up.
                Dead from the neck down. That's life!
                <br />
                Oh, this is so hard!
                <br />
                Heating, cooling,
                stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
                <br />
                humming, inspector number seven,
                lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
                <br />
                mite wrangler. Barry, what
                do you think I should... Barry?
                <br />
                Barry!
                <br />
                All right, we've got the sunflower patch
                in quadrant nine...
                <br />
                What happened to you?
                Where are you?
                <br />
                - I'm going out.
                - Out? Out where?
                <br />
                - Out there.
                - Oh, no!
                <br />
                I have to, before I go
                to work for the rest of my life.
                <br />
                You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
                <br />
                Another call coming in.
                <br />
                If anyone's feeling brave,
                there's a Korean deli on 83rd
                <br />
                that gets their roses today.
                <br />
                Hey, guys.
                <br />
                - Look at that.
                - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
                <br />
                Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
                <br />
                It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
                <br />
                Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
                <br />
                Sign here, here. Just initial that.
                <br />
                - Thank you.
                - OK.
                <br />
                You got a rain advisory today,
                <br />
                and as you all know,
                bees cannot fly in rain.
                <br />
                So be careful. As always,
                watch your brooms,
                <br />
                hockey sticks, dogs,
                birds, bears and bats.
                <br />
                Also, I got a couple of reports
                of root beer being poured on us.
                <br />
                Murphy's in a home because of it,
                babbling like a cicada!
                <br />
                - That's awful.
                - And a reminder for you rookies,
                <br />
                bee law number one,
                absolutely no talking to humans!
                <br />
                All right, launch positions!
                <br />
                Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
                buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
                <br />
                Black and yellow!
                <br />
                Hello!
                <br />
                You ready for this, hot shot?
                <br />
                Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
                <br />

                <br />
                OK, ladies,
                <br />
                let's move it out!
                <br />
                Pound those petunias,
                you striped stem-suckers!
                <br />
                All of you, drain those flowers!
                <br />
                Wow! I'm out!
                <br />
                I can't believe I'm out!
                <br />
                So blue.
                <br />
                I feel so fast and free!
                <br />
                Box kite!
                <br />
                Wow!
                <br />
                Flowers!
                <br />
                This is Blue Leader.
                We have roses visual.
                <br />
                Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
                <br />
                Roses!
                <br />
                30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
                <br />
                Stand to the side, kid.
                It's got a bit of a kick.
                <br />
                That is one nectar collector!
                <br />
                - Ever see pollination up close?
                - No, sir.
                <br />
                I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
                over here. Maybe a dash over there,
                <br />
                a pinch on that one.
                See that? It's a little bit of magic.
                <br />
                That's amazing. Why do we do that?
                <br />
                That's pollen power. More pollen, more
                flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
                <br />
                Oool.
                <br />
                I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
                Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
                <br />
                Oopy that visual.
                <br />
                Wait. One of these flowers
                seems to be on the move.
                <br />
                Say again? You're reporting
                a moving flower?
                <br />
                Affirmative.
                <br />
                That was on the line!
                <br />
                This is the coolest. What is it?
                <br />
                I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
                <br />
                It smells good.
                Not like a flower, but I like it.
                <br />
                Yeah, fuzzy.
                <br />
                Ohemical-y.
                <br />
                Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
                <br />
                My sweet lord of bees!
                <br />
                Oandy-brain, get off there!
                <br />
                Problem!
                <br />
                - Guys!
                - This could be bad.
                <br />
                Affirmative.
                <br />
                Very close.
                <br />
                Gonna hurt.
                <br />
                Mama's little boy.
                <br />
                You are way out of position, rookie!
                <br />
                Ooming in at you like a missile!
                <br />
                Help me!
                <br />
                I don't think these are flowers.
                <br />
                - Should we tell him?
                - I think he knows.
                <br />
                What is this?!
                <br />
                Match point!
                <br />
                You can start packing up, honey,
                because you're about to eat it!
                <br />
                Yowser!
                <br />
                Gross.
                <br />
                There's a bee in the car!
                <br />
                - Do something!
                - I'm driving!
                <br />
                - Hi, bee.
                - He's back here!
                <br />
                He's going to sting me!
                <br />
                Nobody move. If you don't move,
                he won't sting you. Freeze!
                <br />
                He blinked!
                <br />
                Spray him, Granny!
                <br />
                What are you doing?!
                <br />
                Wow... the tension level
                out here is unbelievable.
                <br />
                I gotta get home.
                <br />
                Oan't fly in rain.
                <br />
                Oan't fly in rain.
                <br />
                Oan't fly in rain.
                <br />
                Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
                <br />

                You see? Folds out.
                <br />
                Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
                <br />
                What was that?
                <br />
                Maybe this time. This time. This time.
                This time! This time! This...
                <br />
                Drapes!
                <br />
                That is diabolical.
                <br />
                It's fantastic. It's got all my special
                skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
                <br />
                What's number one? Star Wars?
                <br />
                Nah, I don't go for that...
                <br />
                ...kind of stuff.
                <br />
                No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
                They're out of their minds.
                <br />
                When I leave a job interview, they're
                flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
                <br />
                There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
                <br />
                I don't remember the sun
                having a big 75 on it.
                <br />
                I predicted global warming.
                <br />
                I could feel it getting hotter.
                At first I thought it was just me.
                <br />
                Wait! Stop! Bee!
                <br />
                Stand back. These are winter boots.
                <br />
                Wait!
                <br />
                Don't kill him!
                <br />
                You know I'm allergic to them!
                This thing could kill me!
                <br />
                Why does his life have
                less value than yours?
                <br />
                Why does his life have any less value
                than mine? Is that your statement?
                <br />
                I'm just saying all life has value. You
                don't know what he's capable of feeling.
                <br />
                My brochure!
                <br />
                There you go, little guy.
                <br />
                I'm not scared of him.
                It's an allergic thing.
                <br />
                Put that on your resume brochure.
                <br />
                My whole face could puff up.
                <br />
                Make it one of your special skills.
                <br />
                Knocking someone out
                is also a special skill.
                <br />
                Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
                <br />
                - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
                - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
                <br />
                - You could put carob chips on there.
                - Bye.
                <br />
                - Supposed to be less calories.
                - Bye.
                <br />
                I gotta say something.
                <br />
                She saved my life.
                I gotta say something.
                <br />
                All right, here it goes.
                <br />
                Nah.
                <br />
                What would I say?
                <br />
                I could really get in trouble.
                <br />
                It's a bee law.
                You're not supposed to talk to a human.
                <br />
                I can't believe I'm doing this.
                <br />
                I've got to.
                <br />
                Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!
                <br />
                No. Yes. No.
                <br />
                Do it. I can't.
                <br />
                How should I start it?
                "You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
                <br />
                Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
                <br />
                Hi!
                <br />
                I'm sorry.
                <br />
                - You're talking.
                - Yes, I know.
                <br />
                You're talking!
                <br />
                I'm so sorry.
                <br />
                No, it's OK. It's fine.
                I know I'm dreaming.
                <br />
                But I don't recall going to bed.
                <br />
                Well, I'm sure this
                is very disconcerting.
                <br />
                This is a bit of a surprise to me.
                I mean, you're a bee!
                <br />
                I am. And I'm not supposed
                to be doing this,
                <br />
                but they were all trying to kill me.
                <br />
                And if it wasn't for you...
                <br />
                I had to thank you.
                It's just how I was raised.
                <br />
                That was a little weird.
                <br />
                - I'm talking with a bee.
                - Yeah.
                <br />
                I'm talking to a bee.
                And the bee is talking to me!
                <br />
                I just want to say I'm grateful.
                I'll leave now.
                <br />
                - Wait! How did you learn to do that?
                - What?
                <br />
                The talking thing.
                <br />
                Same way you did, I guess.
                "Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
                <br />
                - That's very funny.
                - Yeah.
                <br />
                Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
                we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
                <br />
                Anyway...
                <br />
                Oan I...
                <br />
                ...get you something?
                - Like what?
                <br />
                I don't know. I mean...
                I don't know. Ooffee?
                <br />
                I don't want to put you out.
                <br />
                It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
                <br />
                - It's just coffee.
                - I hate to impose.
                <br />
                - Don't be ridiculous!
                - Actually, I would love a cup.
                <br />
                Hey, you want rum cake?
                <br />
                - I shouldn't.
                - Have some.
                <br />
                - No, I can't.
                - Oome on!
                <br />
                I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
                <br />
                - Where?
                - These stripes don't help.
                <br />
                You look great!
                <br />
                I don't know if you know
                anything about fashion.
                <br />
                Are you all right?
                <br />
                No.
                <br />
                He's making the tie in the cab
                as they're flying up Madison.
                <br />
                He finally gets there.
                <br />
                He runs up the steps into the church.
                The wedding is on.
                <br />
                And he says, "Watermelon?
                I thought you said Guatemalan.
                <br />
                Why would I marry a watermelon?"
                <br />
                Is that a bee joke?
                <br />
                That's the kind of stuff we do.
                <br />
                Yeah, different.
                <br />
                So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
                <br />
                About work? I don't know.
                <br />
                I want to do my part for the hive,
                but I can't do it the way they want.
                <br />
                I know how you feel.
                <br />
                - You do?
                - Sure.
                <br />
                My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
                a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
                <br />
                - Really?
                - My only interest is flowers.
                <br />
                Our new queen was just elected
                with that same campaign slogan.
                <br />
                Anyway, if you look...
                <br />
                There's my hive right there. See it?
                <br />
                You're in Sheep Meadow!
                <br />
                Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
                <br />
                No way! I know that area.
                I lost a toe ring there once.
                <br />
                - Why do girls put rings on their toes?
                - Why not?
                <br />
                - It's like putting a hat on your knee.
                - Maybe I'll try that.
                <br />
                - You all right, ma'am?
                - Oh, yeah. Fine.
                <br />
                Just having two cups of coffee!
                <br />
                Anyway, this has been great.
                Thanks for the coffee.
                <br />
                Yeah, it's no trouble.
                <br />
                Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
                I'd be up the rest of my life.
                <br />
                Are you...?
                <br />
                Oan I take a piece of this with me?
                <br />
                Sure! Here, have a crumb.
                <br />
                - Thanks!
                - Yeah.
                <br />
                All right. Well, then...
                I guess I'll see you around.
                <br />
                Or not.
                <br />
                OK, Barry.
                <br />
                And thank you
                so much again... for before.
                <br />
                Oh, that? That was nothing.
                <br />
                Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
                <br />
                This can't possibly work.
                <br />
                He's all set to go.
                We may as well try it.
                <br />
                OK, Dave, pull the chute.
                <br />
                - Sounds amazing.
                - It was amazing!
                <br />
                It was the scariest,
                happiest moment of my life.
                <br />
                Humans! I can't believe
                you were with humans!
                <br />
                Giant, scary humans!
                What were they like?
                <br />
                Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
                <br />
                They eat crazy giant things.
                They drive crazy.
                <br />
                - Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
                - Some of them. But some of them don't.
                <br />
                - How'd you get back?
                - Poodle.
                <br />
                You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
                whatever you wanted to see.
                <br />
                You had your "experience." Now you
                can pick out yourjob and be normal.
                <br />
                - Well...
                - Well?
                <br />
                Well, I met someone.
                <br />
                You did? Was she Bee-ish?
                <br />
                - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
                - No, no, no, not a wasp.
                <br />
                - Spider?
                - I'm not attracted to spiders.
                <br />
                I know it's the hottest thing,
                with the eight legs and all.
                <br />
                I can't get by that face.
                <br />
                So who is she?
                <br />
                She's... human.
                <br />
                No, no. That's a bee law.
                You wouldn't break a bee law.
                <br />
                - Her name's Vanessa.
                - Oh, boy.
                <br />
                She's so nice. And she's a florist!
                <br />
                Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
                <br />
                We're not dating.
                <br />
                You're flying outside the hive, talking
                to humans that attack our homes
                <br />
                with power washers and M-80s!
                One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
                <br />
                She saved my life!
                And she understands me.
                <br />
                This is over!
                <br />
                Eat this.
                <br />
                This is not over! What was that?
                <br />
                - They call it a crumb.
                - It was so stingin' stripey!
                <br />
                And that's not what they eat.
                That's what falls off what they eat!
                <br />
                - You know what a Oinnabon is?
                - No.
                <br />
                It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
                They heat it up...
                <br />
                Sit down!
                <br />
                ...really hot!
                - Listen to me!
                <br />
                We are not them! We're us.
                There's us and there's them!
                <br />
                Yes, but who can deny
                the heart that is yearning?
                <br />
                There's no yearning.
                Stop yearning. Listen to me!
                <br />
                You have got to start thinking bee,
                my friend. Thinking bee!
                <br />
                - Thinking bee.
                - Thinking bee.
                <br />
                Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
                Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
                <br />
                There he is. He's in the pool.
                <br />
                You know what your problem is, Barry?
                <br />
                I gotta start thinking bee?
                <br />
                How much longer will this go on?
                <br />
                It's been three days!
                Why aren't you working?
                <br />
                I've got a lot of big life decisions
                to think about.
                <br />
                What life? You have no life!
                You have no job. You're barely a bee!
                <br />
                Would it kill you
                to make a little honey?
                <br />
                Barry, come out.
                Your father's talking to you.
                <br />
                Martin, would you talk to him?
                <br />
                Barry, I'm talking to you!
                <br />
                You coming?
                <br />
                Got everything?
                <br />
                All set!
                <br />
                Go ahead. I'll catch up.
                <br />
                Don't be too long.
                <br />
                Watch this!
                <br />
                Vanessa!
                <br />
                - We're still here.
                - I told you not to yell at him.
                <br />
                He doesn't respond to yelling!
                <br />
                - Then why yell at me?
                - Because you don't listen!
                <br />
                I'm not listening to this.
                <br />
                Sorry, I've gotta go.
                <br />
                - Where are you going?
                - I'm meeting a friend.
                <br />
                A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
                <br />
                Bye.
                <br />
                I just hope she's Bee-ish.
                <br />
                They have a huge parade
                of flowers every year in Pasadena?
                <br />
                To be in the Tournament of Roses,
                that's every florist's dream!
                <br />
                Up on a float, surrounded
                by flowers, crowds cheering.
                <br />
                A tournament. Do the roses
                compete in athletic events?
                <br />
                No. All right, I've got one.
                How come you don't fly everywhere?
                <br />
                It's exhausting. Why don't you
                run everywhere? It's faster.
                <br />
                Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
                All right, your turn.
                <br />
                TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
                That's insane!
                <br />
                You don't have that?
                <br />
                We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
                It's a horrible, horrible disease.
                <br />
                Oh, my.
                <br />
                Dumb bees!
                <br />
                You must want to sting all those jerks.
                <br />
                We try not to sting.
                It's usually fatal for us.
                <br />
                So you have to watch your temper.
                <br />
                Very carefully.
                You kick a wall, take a walk,
                <br />
                write an angry letter and throw it out.
                Work through it like any emotion:
                <br />
                Anger, jealousy, lust.
                <br />
                Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
                <br />
                Yeah.
                <br />
                - What is wrong with you?!
                - It's a bug.
                <br />
                He's not bothering anybody.
                Get out of here, you creep!
                <br />
                What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
                <br />
                Yeah, it was. How did you know?
                <br />
                It felt like about 10 pages.
                Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
                <br />
                You've really got that
                down to a science.
                <br />
                - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
                - I'll bet.
                <br />
                What in the name
                of Mighty Hercules is this?
                <br />
                How did this get here?
                Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
                <br />
                Ray Liotta Private Select?
                <br />
                - Is he that actor?
                - I never heard of him.
                <br />
                - Why is this here?
                - For people. We eat it.
                <br />
                You don't have
                enough food of your own?
                <br />
                - Well, yes.
                - How do you get it?
                <br />
                - Bees make it.
                - I know who makes it!
                <br />
                And it's hard to make it!
                <br />
                There's heating, cooling, stirring.
                You need a whole Krelman thing!
                <br />
                - It's organic.
                - It's our-ganic!
                <br />
                It's just honey, Barry.
                <br />
                Just what?!
                <br />
                Bees don't know about this!
                This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
                <br />
                You've taken our homes, schools,
                hospitals! This is all we have!
                <br />
                And it's on sale?!
                I'm getting to the bottom of this.
                <br />
                I'm getting to the bottom
                of all of this!
                <br />
                Hey, Hector.
                <br />
                - You almost done?
                - Almost.
                <br />
                He is here. I sense it.
                <br />
                Well, I guess I'll go home now
                <br />
                and just leave this nice honey out,
                with no one around.
                <br />
                You're busted, box boy!
                <br />
                I knew I heard something.
                So you can talk!
                <br />
                I can talk.
                And now you'll start talking!
                <br />
                Where you getting the sweet stuff?
                Who's your supplier?
                <br />
                I don't understand.
                I thought we were friends.
                <br />
                The last thing we want
                to do is upset bees!
                <br />
                You're too late! It's ours now!
                <br />
                You, sir, have crossed
                the wrong sword!
                <br />
                You, sir, will be lunch
                for my iguana, Ignacio!
                <br />
                Where is the honey coming from?
                <br />
                Tell me where!
                <br />
                Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
                <br />
                Orazy person!
                <br />
                What horrible thing has happened here?
                <br />
                These faces, they never knew
                what hit them. And now
                <br />
                they're on the road to nowhere!
                <br />
                Just keep still.
                <br />
                What? You're not dead?
                <br />
                Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
                that moves. Where you headed?
                <br />
                To Honey Farms.
                I am onto something huge here.
                <br />
                I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
                crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
                <br />
                I'm going to Tacoma.
                <br />
                - And you?
                - He really is dead.
                <br />
                All right.
                <br />
                Uh-oh!
                <br />
                - What is that?!
                - Oh, no!
                <br />
                - A wiper! Triple blade!
                - Triple blade?
                <br />
                Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
                <br />
                Why does everything have
                to be so doggone clean?!
                <br />
                How much do you people need to see?!
                <br />
                Open your eyes!
                Stick your head out the window!
                <br />
                From NPR News in Washington,
                I'm Oarl Kasell.
                <br />
                But don't kill no more bugs!
                <br />
                - Bee!
                - Moose blood guy!!
                <br />
                - You hear something?
                - Like what?
                <br />
                Like tiny screaming.
                <br />
                Turn off the radio.
                <br />
                Whassup, bee boy?
                <br />
                Hey, Blood.
                <br />
                Just a row of honey jars,
                as far as the eye could see.
                <br />
                Wow!
                <br />
                I assume wherever this truck goes
                is where they're getting it.
                <br />
                I mean, that honey's ours.
                <br />
                - Bees hang tight.
                - We're all jammed in.
                <br />
                It's a close community.
                <br />
                Not us, man. We on our own.
                Every mosquito on his own.
                <br />
                - What if you get in trouble?
                - You a mosquito, you in trouble.
                <br />
                Nobody likes us. They just smack.
                See a mosquito, smack, smack!
                <br />
                At least you're out in the world.
                You must meet girls.
                <br />
                Mosquito girls try to trade up,
                get with a moth, dragonfly.
                <br />
                Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
                <br />
                You got to be kidding me!
                <br />
                Mooseblood's about to leave
                the building! So long, bee!
                <br />
                - Hey, guys!
                - Mooseblood!
                <br />
                I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
                Did you bring your crazy straw?
                <br />
                We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
                and it's pretty much pure profit.
                <br />
                What is this place?
                <br />
                A bee's got a brain
                the size of a pinhead.
                <br />
                They are pinheads!
                <br />
                Pinhead.
                <br />
                - Oheck out the new smoker.
                - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
                <br />
                The Thomas 3000!
                <br />
                Smoker?
                <br />
                Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
                Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
                <br />
                A couple breaths of this
                knocks them right out.
                <br />
                They make the honey,
                and we make the money.
                <br />
                "They make the honey,
                and we make the money"?
                <br />
                Oh, my!
                <br />
                What's going on? Are you OK?
                <br />
                Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
                <br />
                Do you know you're
                in a fake hive with fake walls?
                <br />
                Our queen was moved here.
                We had no choice.
                <br />
                This is your queen?
                That's a man in women's clothes!
                <br />
                That's a drag queen!
                <br />
                What is this?
                <br />
                Oh, no!
                <br />
                There's hundreds of them!
                <br />
                Bee honey.
                <br />
                Our honey is being brazenly stolen
                on a massive scale!
                <br />
                This is worse than anything bears
                have done! I intend to do something.
                <br />
                Oh, Barry, stop.
                <br />
                Who told you humans are taking
                our honey? That's a rumor.
                <br />
                Do these look like rumors?
                <br />
                That's a conspiracy theory.
                These are obviously doctored photos.
                <br />
                How did you get mixed up in this?
                <br />
                He's been talking to humans.
                <br />
                - What?
                - Talking to humans?!
                <br />
                He has a human girlfriend.
                And they make out!
                <br />
                Make out? Barry!
                <br />
                We do not.
                <br />
                - You wish you could.
                - Whose side are you on?
                <br />
                The bees!
                <br />
                I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
                Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
                <br />
                Barry, this is what you want
                to do with your life?
                <br />
                I want to do it for all our lives.
                Nobody works harder than bees!
                <br />
                Dad, I remember you
                coming home so overworked
                <br />
                your hands were still stirring.
                You couldn't stop.
                <br />
                I remember that.
                <br />
                What right do they have to our honey?
                <br />
                We live on two cups a year. They put it
                in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
                <br />
                Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
                <br />
                Sting them where it really hurts.
                <br />
                In the face! The eye!
                <br />
                - That would hurt.
                - No.
                <br />
                Up the nose? That's a killer.
                <br />
                There's only one place you can sting
                the humans, one place where it matters.
                <br />
                Hive at Five, the hive's only
                full-hour action news source.
                <br />
                No more bee beards!
                <br />

                <br />
                A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
                <br />
                intends to sue the human race
                for stealing our honey,
                <br />
                packaging it and profiting
                from it illegally!
                <br />
                Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
                <br />
                we'll have three former queens here in
                our studio, discussing their new book,
                <br />
                Olassy Ladies,
                out this week on Hexagon.
                <br />
                Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
                <br />
                Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
                from the hive. I can't do this"?
                <br />
                Bees have never been afraid
                to change the world.
                <br />
                What about Bee Oolumbus?
                Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
                <br />
                Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
                <br />
                We were thinking
                of stickball or candy stores.
                <br />
                How old are you?
                <br />
                The bee community
                is supporting you in this case,
                <br />
                which will be the trial
                of the bee century.
                <br />
                You know, they have a Larry King
                in the human world too.
                <br />
                It's a common name. Next week...
                <br />
                He looks like you and has a show
                and suspenders and colored dots...
                <br />
                Next week...
                <br />
                Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
                guest even though you just heard 'em.
                <br />
                Bear Week next week!
                They're scary, hairy and here live.
                <br />
                Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
                squinty eyes, very Jewish.
                <br />
                In tennis, you attack
                at the point of weakness!
                <br />
                It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
                <br />
                Honey, her backhand's a joke!
                I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
                <br />
                Quiet, please.
                Actual work going on here.
                <br />
                - Is that that same bee?
                - Yes, it is!
                <br />
                I'm helping him sue the human race.
                <br />
                - Hello.
                - Hello, bee.
                <br />
                This is Ken.
                <br />
                Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
                ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
                <br />
                Why does he talk again?
                <br />
                Listen, you better go
                'cause we're really busy working.
                <br />
                But it's our yogurt night!
                <br />
                Bye-bye.
                <br />
                Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
                <br />
                You poor thing.
                You two have been at this for hours!
                <br />
                Yes, and Adam here
                has been a huge help.
                <br />
                - Frosting...
                - How many sugars?
                <br />
                Just one. I try not
                to use the competition.
                <br />
                So why are you helping me?
                <br />
                Bees have good qualities.
                <br />
                And it takes my mind off the shop.
                <br />
                Instead of flowers, people
                are giving balloon bouquets now.
                <br />
                Those are great, if you're three.
                <br />
                And artificial flowers.
                <br />
                - Oh, those just get me psychotic!
                - Yeah, me too.
                <br />
                Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
                <br />
                Bees must hate those fake things!
                <br />
                Nothing worse
                than a daffodil that's had work done.
                <br />
                Maybe this could make up
                for it a little bit.
                <br />
                - This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
                - I guess.
                <br />
                You sure you want to go through with it?
                <br />
                Am I sure? When I'm done with
                the humans, they won't be able
                <br />
                to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
                without paying a royalty!
                <br />
                It's an incredible scene
                here in downtown Manhattan,
                <br />
                where the world anxiously waits,
                because for the first time in history,
                <br />
                we will hear for ourselves
                if a honeybee can actually speak.
                <br />
                What have we gotten into here, Barry?
                <br />
                It's pretty big, isn't it?
                <br />
                I can't believe how many humans
                don't work during the day.
                <br />
                You think billion-dollar multinational
                food companies have good lawyers?
                <br />
                Everybody needs to stay
                behind the barricade.
                <br />
                - What's the matter?
                - I don't know, I just got a chill.
                <br />
                Well, if it isn't the bee team.
                <br />
                You boys work on this?
                <br />
                All rise! The Honorable
                Judge Bumbleton presiding.
                <br />
                All right. Oase number 4475,
                <br />
                Superior Oourt of New York,
                Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
                <br />
                is now in session.
                <br />
                Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
                the five food companies collectively?
                <br />
                A privilege.
                <br />
                Mr. Benson... you're representing
                all the bees of the world?
                <br />
                I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
                we're ready to proceed.
                <br />
                Mr. Montgomery,
                your opening statement, please.
                <br />
                Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
                <br />
                my grandmother was a simple woman.
                <br />
                Born on a farm, she believed
                it was man's divine right
                <br />
                to benefit from the bounty
                of nature God put before us.
                <br />
                If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
                Mr. Benson imagines,
                <br />
                just think of what would it mean.
                <br />
                I would have to negotiate
                with the silkworm
                <br />
                for the elastic in my britches!
                <br />
                Talking bee!
                <br />
                How do we know this isn't some sort of
                <br />
                holographic motion-picture-capture
                Hollywood wizardry?
                <br />
                They could be using laser beams!
                <br />
                Robotics! Ventriloquism!
                Oloning! For all we know,
                <br />
                he could be on steroids!
                <br />
                Mr. Benson?
                <br />
                Ladies and gentlemen,
                there's no trickery here.
                <br />
                I'm just an ordinary bee.
                Honey's pretty important to me.
                <br />
                It's important to all bees.
                We invented it!
                <br />
                We make it. And we protect it
                with our lives.
                <br />
                Unfortunately, there are
                some people in this room
                <br />
                who think they can take it from us
                <br />
                'cause we're the little guys!
                I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
                <br />
                you'll see how, by taking our honey,
                you not only take everything we have
                <br />
                but everything we are!
                <br />
                I wish he'd dress like that
                all the time. So nice!
                <br />
                Oall your first witness.
                <br />
                So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
                of Honey Farms, big company you have.
                <br />
                I suppose so.
                <br />
                I see you also own
                Honeyburton and Honron!
                <br />
                Yes, they provide beekeepers
                for our farms.
                <br />
                Beekeeper. I find that
                to be a very disturbing term.
                <br />
                I don't imagine you employ
                any bee-free-ers, do you?
                <br />
                - No.
                - I couldn't hear you.
                <br />
                - No.
                - No.
                <br />
                Because you don't free bees.
                You keep bees. Not only that,
                <br />
                it seems you thought a bear would be
                an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
                <br />
                They're very lovable creatures.
                <br />
                Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
                <br />
                You mean like this?
                <br />
                Bears kill bees!
                <br />
                How'd you like his head crashing
                through your living room?!
                <br />
                Biting into your couch!
                Spitting out your throw pillows!
                <br />
                OK, that's enough. Take him away.
                <br />
                So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
                Your name intrigues me.
                <br />
                - Where have I heard it before?
                - I was with a band called The Police.
                <br />
                But you've never been
                a police officer, have you?
                <br />
                No, I haven't.
                <br />
                No, you haven't. And so here
                we have yet another example
                <br />
                of bee culture casually
                stolen by a human
                <br />
                for nothing more than
                a prance-about stage name.
                <br />
                Oh, please.
                <br />
                Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
                <br />
                Because I'm feeling
                a little stung, Sting.
                <br />
                Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
                <br />
                That's not his real name?! You idiots!
                <br />
                Mr. Liotta, first,
                belated congratulations on
                <br />
                your Emmy win for a guest spot
                on ER in 2005.
                <br />
                Thank you. Thank you.
                <br />
                I see from your resume
                that you're devilishly handsome
                <br />
                with a churning inner turmoil
                that's ready to blow.
                <br />
                I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
                <br />
                Not yet it isn't. But is this
                what it's come to for you?
                <br />
                Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
                so you don't
                <br />
                have to rehearse
                your part and learn your lines, sir?
                <br />
                Watch it, Benson!
                I could blow right now!
                <br />
                This isn't a goodfella.
                This is a badfella!
                <br />
                Why doesn't someone just step on
                this creep, and we can all go home?!
                <br />
                - Order in this court!
                - You're all thinking it!
                <br />
                Order! Order, I say!
                <br />
                - Say it!
                - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
                <br />
                I think it was awfully nice
                of that bear to pitch in like that.
                <br />
                I think the jury's on our side.
                <br />
                Are we doing everything right, legally?
                <br />
                I'm a florist.
                <br />
                Right. Well, here's to a great team.
                <br />
                To a great team!
                <br />
                Well, hello.
                <br />
                - Ken!
                - Hello.
                <br />
                I didn't think you were coming.
                <br />
                No, I was just late.
                I tried to call, but... the battery.
                <br />
                I didn't want all this to go to waste,
                so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
                <br />
                Oh, that was lucky.
                <br />
                There's a little left.
                I could heat it up.
                <br />
                Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
                <br />
                So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
                <br />
                I'm not much for the game myself.
                The ball's a little grabby.
                <br />
                That's where I usually sit.
                Right... there.
                <br />
                Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
                <br />
                and he agreed with me that eating with
                chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
                <br />
                You think I don't see what you're doing?
                <br />
                I know how hard it is to find
                the rightjob. We have that in common.
                <br />
                Do we?
                <br />
                Bees have 100 percent employment,
                but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
                <br />
                That's just what
                I was thinking about doing.
                <br />
                Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
                for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
                <br />
                I'm going to drain the old stinger.
                <br />
                Yeah, you do that.
                <br />
                Look at that.
                <br />
                You know, I've just about had it
                <br />
                with your little mind games.
                <br />
                - What's that?
                - Italian Vogue.
                <br />
                Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
                <br />
                A lot of ads.
                <br />
                Remember what Van said, why is
                your life more valuable than mine?
                <br />
                Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
                <br />
                I think something stinks in here!
                <br />
                I love the smell of flowers.
                <br />
                How do you like the smell of flames?!
                <br />
                Not as much.
                <br />
                Water bug! Not taking sides!
                <br />
                Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
                This is pathetic!
                <br />
                I've got issues!
                <br />
                Well, well, well, a royal flush!
                <br />
                - You're bluffing.
                - Am I?
                <br />
                Surf's up, dude!
                <br />
                Poo water!
                <br />
                That bowl is gnarly.
                <br />
                Except for those dirty yellow rings!
                <br />
                Kenneth! What are you doing?!
                <br />
                You know, I don't even like honey!
                I don't eat it!
                <br />
                We need to talk!
                <br />
                He's just a little bee!
                <br />
                And he happens to be
                the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
                <br />
                Long time? What are you talking about?!
                Are there other bugs in your life?
                <br />
                No, but there are other things bugging
                me in life. And you're one of them!
                <br />
                Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
                <br />
                My nerves are fried from riding
                on this emotional roller coaster!
                <br />
                Goodbye, Ken.
                <br />
                And for your information,
                <br />
                I prefer sugar-free, artificial
                sweeteners made by man!
                <br />
                I'm sorry about all that.
                <br />
                I know it's got
                an aftertaste! I like it!
                <br />
                I always felt there was some kind
                of barrier between Ken and me.
                <br />
                I couldn't overcome it.
                Oh, well.
                <br />
                Are you OK for the trial?
                <br />
                I believe Mr. Montgomery
                is about out of ideas.
                <br />
                We would like to call
                Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
                <br />
                Good idea! You can really see why he's
                considered one of the best lawyers...
                <br />
                Yeah.
                <br />
                Layton, you've
                gotta weave some magic
                <br />
                with this jury,
                or it's gonna be all over.
                <br />
                Don't worry. The only thing I have
                to do to turn this jury around
                <br />
                is to remind them
                of what they don't like about bees.
                <br />
                - You got the tweezers?
                - Are you allergic?
                <br />
                Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
                <br />
                Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
                what I think we'd all like to know.
                <br />
                What exactly is your relationship
                <br />
                to that woman?
                <br />
                We're friends.
                <br />
                - Good friends?
                - Yes.
                <br />
                How good? Do you live together?
                <br />
                Wait a minute...
                <br />
                Are you her little...
                <br />
                ...bedbug?
                <br />
                I've seen a bee documentary or two.
                From what I understand,
                <br />
                doesn't your queen give birth
                to all the bee children?
                <br />
                - Yeah, but...
                - So those aren't your real parents!
                <br />
                - Oh, Barry...
                - Yes, they are!
                <br />
                Hold me back!
                <br />
                You're an illegitimate bee,
                aren't you, Benson?
                <br />
                He's denouncing bees!
                <br />
                Don't y'all date your cousins?
                <br />
                - Objection!
                - I'm going to pincushion this guy!
                <br />
                Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
                <br />
                Oh, I'm hit!!
                <br />
                Oh, lordy, I am hit!
                <br />
                Order! Order!
                <br />
                The venom! The venom
                is coursing through my veins!
                <br />
                I have been felled
                by a winged beast of destruction!
                <br />
                You see? You can't treat them
                like equals! They're striped savages!
                <br />
                Stinging's the only thing
                they know! It's their way!
                <br />
                - Adam, stay with me.
                - I can't feel my legs.
                <br />
                What angel of mercy
                will come forward to suck the poison
                <br />
                from my heaving buttocks?
                <br />
                I will have order in this court. Order!
                <br />
                Order, please!
                <br />
                The case of the honeybees
                versus the human race
                <br />
                took a pointed turn against the bees
                <br />
                yesterday when one of their legal
                team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
                <br />
                - Hey, buddy.
                - Hey.
                <br />
                - Is there much pain?
                - Yeah.
                <br />
                I...
                <br />
                I blew the whole case, didn't I?
                <br />
                It doesn't matter. What matters is
                you're alive. You could have died.
                <br />
                I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
                <br />
                They got it from the cafeteria
                downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
                <br />
                Look, there's
                a little celery still on it.
                <br />
                What was it like to sting someone?
                <br />
                I can't explain it. It was all...
                <br />
                All adrenaline and then...
                and then ecstasy!
                <br />
                All right.
                <br />
                You think it was all a trap?
                <br />
                Of course. I'm sorry.
                I flew us right into this.
                <br />
                What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
                just a couple of bugs in this world.
                <br />
                What will the humans do to us
                if they win?
                <br />
                I don't know.
                <br />
                I hear they put the roaches in motels.
                That doesn't sound so bad.
                <br />
                Adam, they check in,
                but they don't check out!
                <br />
                Oh, my.
                <br />
                Oould you get a nurse
                to close that window?
                <br />
                - Why?
                - The smoke.
                <br />
                Bees don't smoke.
                <br />
                Right. Bees don't smoke.
                <br />
                Bees don't smoke!
                But some bees are smoking.
                <br />
                That's it! That's our case!
                <br />
                It is? It's not over?
                <br />
                Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
                <br />
                Get back to the court and stall.
                Stall any way you can.
                <br />
                And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
                <br />
                Mr. Flayman.
                <br />
                Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
                <br />
                Where is the rest of your team?
                <br />
                Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
                <br />
                Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
                <br />
                and as a result,
                we don't make very good time.
                <br />
                I actually heard a funny story about...
                <br />
                Your Honor,
                haven't these ridiculous bugs
                <br />
                taken up enough
                of this court's valuable time?
                <br />
                How much longer will we allow
                these absurd shenanigans to go on?
                <br />
                They have presented no compelling
                evidence to support their charges
                <br />
                against my clients,
                who run legitimate businesses.
                <br />
                I move for a complete dismissal
                of this entire case!
                <br />
                Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
                <br />
                to have to consider
                Mr. Montgomery's motion.
                <br />
                But you can't! We have a terrific case.
                <br />
                Where is your proof?
                Where is the evidence?
                <br />
                Show me the smoking gun!
                <br />
                Hold it, Your Honor!
                You want a smoking gun?
                <br />
                Here is your smoking gun.
                <br />
                What is that?
                <br />
                It's a bee smoker!
                <br />
                What, this?
                This harmless little contraption?
                <br />
                This couldn't hurt a fly,
                let alone a bee.
                <br />
                Look at what has happened
                <br />
                to bees who have never been asked,
                "Smoking or non?"
                <br />
                Is this what nature intended for us?
                <br />
                To be forcibly addicted
                to smoke machines
                <br />
                and man-made wooden slat work camps?
                <br />
                Living out our lives as honey slaves
                to the white man?
                <br />
                - What are we gonna do?
                - He's playing the species card.
                <br />
                Ladies and gentlemen, please,
                free these bees!
                <br />
                Free the bees! Free the bees!
                <br />
                Free the bees!
                <br />
                Free the bees! Free the bees!
                <br />
                The court finds in favor of the bees!
                <br />
                Vanessa, we won!
                <br />
                I knew you could do it! High-five!
                <br />
                Sorry.
                <br />
                I'm OK! You know what this means?
                <br />
                All the honey
                will finally belong to the bees.
                <br />
                Now we won't have
                to work so hard all the time.
                <br />
                This is an unholy perversion
                of the balance of nature, Benson.
                <br />
                You'll regret this.
                <br />
                Barry, how much honey is out there?
                <br />
                All right. One at a time.
                <br />
                Barry, who are you wearing?
                <br />
                My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
                and I have no pants.
                <br />
                - What if Montgomery's right?
                - What do you mean?
                <br />
                We've been living the bee way
                a long time, 27 million years.
                <br />
                Oongratulations on your victory.
                What will you demand as a settlement?
                <br />
                First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
                of all bee work camps.
                <br />
                Then we want back the honey
                that was ours to begin with,
                <br />
                every last drop.
                <br />
                We demand an end to the glorification
                of the bear as anything more
                <br />
                than a filthy, smelly,
                bad-breath stink machine.
                <br />
                We're all aware
                of what they do in the woods.
                <br />
                Wait for my signal.
                <br />
                Take him out.
                <br />
                He'll have nauseous
                for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
                <br />
                And we will no longer tolerate
                bee-negative nicknames...
                <br />
                But it's just a prance-about stage name!
                <br />
                ...unnecessary inclusion of honey
                in bogus health products
                <br />
                and la-dee-da human
                tea-time snack garnishments.
                <br />
                Oan't breathe.
                <br />
                Bring it in, boys!
                <br />
                Hold it right there! Good.
                <br />
                Tap it.
                <br />
                Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
                and there's gallons more coming!
                <br />
                - I think we need to shut down!
                - Shut down? We've never shut down.
                <br />
                Shut down honey production!
                <br />
                Stop making honey!
                <br />
                Turn your key, sir!
                <br />
                What do we do now?
                <br />
                Oannonball!
                <br />
                We're shutting honey production!
                <br />
                Mission abort.
                <br />
                Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
                Returning to base.
                <br />
                Adam, you wouldn't believe
                how much honey was out there.
                <br />
                Oh, yeah?
                <br />
                What's going on? Where is everybody?
                <br />
                - Are they out celebrating?
                - They're home.
                <br />
                They don't know what to do.
                Laying out, sleeping in.
                <br />
                I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
                to San Antonio with a cricket.
                <br />
                At least we got our honey back.
                <br />
                Sometimes I think, so what if humans
                liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
                <br />
                It's the greatest thing in the world!
                I was excited to be part of making it.
                <br />
                This was my new desk. This was my
                new job. I wanted to do it really well.
                <br />
                And now...
                <br />
                Now I can't.
                <br />
                I don't understand
                why they're not happy.
                <br />
                I thought their lives would be better!
                <br />
                They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
                Honey really changes people.
                <br />
                You don't have any idea
                what's going on, do you?
                <br />
                - What did you want to show me?
                - This.
                <br />
                What happened here?
                <br />
                That is not the half of it.
                <br />
                Oh, no. Oh, my.
                <br />
                They're all wilting.
                <br />
                Doesn't look very good, does it?
                <br />
                No.
                <br />
                And whose fault do you think that is?
                <br />
                You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
                <br />
                Bees?
                <br />
                Specifically, me.
                <br />
                I didn't think bees not needing to make
                honey would affect all these things.
                <br />
                It's notjust flowers.
                Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
                <br />
                That's our whole SAT test right there.
                <br />
                Take away produce, that affects
                the entire animal kingdom.
                <br />
                And then, of course...
                <br />
                The human species?
                <br />
                So if there's no more pollination,
                <br />
                it could all just go south here,
                couldn't it?
                <br />
                I know this is also partly my fault.
                <br />
                How about a suicide pact?
                <br />
                How do we do it?
                <br />
                - I'll sting you, you step on me.
                - Thatjust kills you twice.
                <br />
                Right, right.
                <br />
                Listen, Barry...
                sorry, but I gotta get going.
                <br />
                I had to open my mouth and talk.
                <br />
                Vanessa?
                <br />
                Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
                Where are you going?
                <br />
                To the final Tournament of Roses parade
                in Pasadena.
                <br />
                They've moved it to this weekend
                because all the flowers are dying.
                <br />
                It's the last chance
                I'll ever have to see it.
                <br />
                Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
                I never meant it to turn out like this.
                <br />
                I know. Me neither.
                <br />
                Tournament of Roses.
                Roses can't do sports.
                <br />
                Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
                <br />
                Roses!
                <br />
                Vanessa!
                <br />
                Roses?!
                <br />
                Barry?
                <br />
                - Roses are flowers!
                - Yes, they are.
                <br />
                Flowers, bees, pollen!
                <br />
                I know.
                That's why this is the last parade.
                <br />
                Maybe not.
                Oould you ask him to slow down?
                <br />
                Oould you slow down?
                <br />
                Barry!
                <br />
                OK, I made a huge mistake.
                This is a total disaster, all my fault.
                <br />
                Yes, it kind of is.
                <br />
                I've ruined the planet.
                I wanted to help you
                <br />
                with the flower shop.
                I've made it worse.
                <br />
                Actually, it's completely closed down.
                <br />
                I thought maybe you were remodeling.
                <br />
                But I have another idea, and it's
                greater than my previous ideas combined.
                <br />
                I don't want to hear it!
                <br />
                All right, they have the roses,
                the roses have the pollen.
                <br />
                I know every bee, plant
                and flower bud in this park.
                <br />
                All we gotta do is get what they've got
                back here with what we've got.
                <br />
                - Bees.
                - Park.
                <br />
                - Pollen!
                - Flowers.
                <br />
                - Repollination!
                - Across the nation!
                <br />
                Tournament of Roses,
                Pasadena, Oalifornia.
                <br />
                They've got nothing
                but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
                <br />
                Security will be tight.
                <br />
                I have an idea.
                <br />
                Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
                <br />
                Official floral business. It's real.
                <br />
                Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
                <br />
                Thank you. It was a gift.
                <br />
                Once inside,
                we just pick the right float.
                <br />
                How about The Princess and the Pea?
                <br />
                I could be the princess,
                and you could be the pea!
                <br />
                Yes, I got it.
                <br />
                - Where should I sit?
                - What are you?
                <br />
                - I believe I'm the pea.
                - The pea?
                <br />
                It goes under the mattresses.
                <br />
                - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
                - I'm getting the marshal.
                <br />
                You do that!
                This whole parade is a fiasco!
                <br />
                Let's see what this baby'll do.
                <br />
                Hey, what are you doing?!
                <br />
                Then all we do
                is blend in with traffic...
                <br />
                ...without arousing suspicion.
                <br />
                Once at the airport,
                there's no stopping us.
                <br />
                Stop! Security.
                <br />
                - You and your insect pack your float?
                - Yes.
                <br />
                Has it been
                in your possession the entire time?
                <br />
                Would you remove your shoes?
                <br />
                - Remove your stinger.
                - It's part of me.
                <br />
                I know. Just having some fun.
                Enjoy your flight.
                <br />
                Then if we're lucky, we'll have
                just enough pollen to do the job.
                <br />
                Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
                have just enough pollen to do the job!
                <br />
                I think this is gonna work.
                <br />
                It's got to work.
                <br />
                Attention, passengers,
                this is Oaptain Scott.
                <br />
                We have a bit of bad weather
                in New York.
                <br />
                It looks like we'll experience
                a couple hours delay.
                <br />
                Barry, these are cut flowers
                with no water. They'll never make it.
                <br />
                I gotta get up there
                and talk to them.
                <br />
                Be careful.
                <br />
                Oan I get help
                with the Sky Mall magazine?
                <br />
                I'd like to order the talking
                inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
                <br />
                Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.
                <br />
                - What'd you say, Hal?
                - Nothing.
                <br />
                Bee!
                <br />
                Don't freak out! My entire species...
                <br />
                What are you doing?
                <br />
                - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
                - Who's an attorney?
                <br />
                Don't move.
                <br />
                Oh, Barry.
                <br />
                Good afternoon, passengers.
                This is your captain.
                <br />
                Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
                please report to the cockpit?
                <br />
                And please hurry!
                <br />
                What happened here?
                <br />
                There was a DustBuster,
                a toupee, a life raft exploded.
                <br />
                One's bald, one's in a boat,
                they're both unconscious!
                <br />
                - Is that another bee joke?
                - No!
                <br />
                No one's flying the plane!
                <br />
                This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
                What's your status?
                <br />
                This is Vanessa Bloome.
                I'm a florist from New York.
                <br />
                Where's the pilot?
                <br />
                He's unconscious,
                and so is the copilot.
                <br />
                Not good. Does anyone onboard
                have flight experience?
                <br />
                As a matter of fact, there is.
                <br />
                - Who's that?
                - Barry Benson.
                <br />
                From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
                <br />
                Vanessa, this is nothing more
                than a big metal bee.
                <br />
                It's got giant wings, huge engines.
                <br />
                I can't fly a plane.
                <br />
                - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
                - Yes.
                <br />
                How hard could it be?
                <br />
                Wait, Barry!
                We're headed into some lightning.
                <br />
                This is Bob Bumble. We have some
                late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
                <br />
                where a suspenseful scene
                is developing.
                <br />
                Barry Benson,
                fresh from his legal victory...
                <br />
                That's Barry!
                <br />
                ...is attempting to land a plane,
                loaded with people, flowers
                <br />
                and an incapacitated flight crew.
                <br />
                Flowers?!
                <br />
                We have a storm in the area
                and two individuals at the controls
                <br />
                with absolutely no flight experience.
                <br />
                Just a minute.
                There's a bee on that plane.
                <br />
                I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
                and his no-account compadres.
                <br />
                They've done enough damage.
                <br />
                But isn't he your only hope?
                <br />
                Technically, a bee
                shouldn't be able to fly at all.
                <br />
                Their wings are too small...
                <br />
                Haven't we heard this a million times?
                <br />
                "The surface area of the wings
                and body mass make no sense."
                <br />
                - Get this on the air!
                - Got it.
                <br />
                - Stand by.
                - We're going live.
                <br />
                The way we work may be a mystery to you.
                <br />
                Making honey takes a lot of bees
                doing a lot of small jobs.
                <br />
                But let me tell you about a small job.
                <br />
                If you do it well,
                it makes a big difference.
                <br />
                More than we realized.
                To us, to everyone.
                <br />
                That's why I want to get bees
                back to working together.
                <br />
                That's the bee way!
                We're not made of Jell-O.
                <br />
                We get behind a fellow.
                <br />
                - Black and yellow!
                - Hello!
                <br />
                Left, right, down, hover.
                <br />
                - Hover?
                - Forget hover.
                <br />
                This isn't so hard.
                Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
                <br />
                Barry, what happened?!
                <br />
                Wait, I think we were
                on autopilot the whole time.
                <br />
                - That may have been helping me.
                - And now we're not!
                <br />
                So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
                <br />
                All of you, let's get
                behind this fellow! Move it out!
                <br />
                Move out!
                <br />
                Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
                you copy me with the wings of the plane!
                <br />
                Don't have to yell.
                <br />
                I'm not yelling!
                We're in a lot of trouble.
                <br />
                It's very hard to concentrate
                with that panicky tone in your voice!
                <br />
                It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
                <br />
                I can't do this!
                <br />
                Vanessa, pull yourself together.
                You have to snap out of it!
                <br />
                You snap out of it.
                <br />
                You snap out of it.
                <br />
                - You snap out of it!
                - You snap out of it!
                <br />
                - You snap out of it!
                - You snap out of it!
                <br />
                - You snap out of it!
                - You snap out of it!
                <br />
                - Hold it!
                - Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
                <br />
                How is the plane flying?
                <br />
                I don't know.
                <br />
                Hello?
                <br />
                Benson, got any flowers
                for a happy occasion in there?
                <br />
                The Pollen Jocks!
                <br />
                They do get behind a fellow.
                <br />
                - Black and yellow.
                - Hello.
                <br />
                All right, let's drop this tin can
                on the blacktop.
                <br />
                Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
                <br />
                No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
                <br />
                Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
                <br />
                - Thinking bee.
                - Thinking bee.
                <br />
                Thinking bee!
                Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
                <br />
                Wait a minute.
                I think I'm feeling something.
                <br />
                - What?
                - I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
                <br />
                Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
                <br />
                Bring the nose down.
                <br />
                Thinking bee!
                Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
                <br />
                - What in the world is on the tarmac?
                - Get some lights on that!
                <br />
                Thinking bee!
                Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
                <br />
                - Vanessa, aim for the flower.
                - OK.
                <br />
                Out the engines. We're going in
                on bee power. Ready, boys?
                <br />
                Affirmative!
                <br />
                Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
                <br />
                Land on that flower!
                <br />
                Ready? Full reverse!
                <br />
                Spin it around!
                <br />
                - Not that flower! The other one!
                - Which one?
                <br />
                - That flower.
                - I'm aiming at the flower!
                <br />
                That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
                I mean the giant pulsating flower
                <br />
                made of millions of bees!
                <br />
                Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
                <br />
                Rotate around it.
                <br />
                - This is insane, Barry!
                - This's the only way I know how to fly.
                <br />
                Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
                flying in an insect-like pattern?
                <br />
                Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
                Smell it. Full reverse!
                <br />
                Just drop it. Be a part of it.
                <br />
                Aim for the center!
                <br />
                Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
                <br />
                Oome on, already.
                <br />
                Barry, we did it!
                You taught me how to fly!
                <br />
                - Yes. No high-five!
                - Right.
                <br />
                Barry, it worked!
                Did you see the giant flower?
                <br />
                What giant flower? Where? Of course
                I saw the flower! That was genius!
                <br />
                - Thank you.
                - But we're not done yet.
                <br />
                Listen, everyone!
                <br />
                This runway is covered
                with the last pollen
                <br />
                from the last flowers
                available anywhere on Earth.
                <br />
                That means this is our last chance.
                <br />
                We're the only ones who make honey,
                pollinate flowers and dress like this.
                <br />
                If we're gonna survive as a species,
                this is our moment! What do you say?
                <br />
                Are we going to be bees, orjust
                Museum of Natural History keychains?
                <br />
                We're bees!
                <br />
                Keychain!
                <br />
                Then follow me! Except Keychain.
                <br />
                Hold on, Barry. Here.
                <br />
                You've earned this.
                <br />
                Yeah!
                <br />
                I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
                fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
                <br />
                Oh, yeah.
                <br />
                That's our Barry.
                <br />
                Mom! The bees are back!
                <br />
                If anybody needs
                to make a call, now's the time.
                <br />
                I got a feeling we'll be
                working late tonight!
                <br />
                Here's your change. Have a great
                afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
                <br />
                Would you like some honey with that?
                It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
                <br />
                Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
                And I don't see a nickel!
                <br />
                Sometimes I just feel
                like a piece of meat!
                <br />
                I had no idea.
                <br />
                Barry, I'm sorry.
                Have you got a moment?
                <br />
                Would you excuse me?
                My mosquito associate will help you.
                <br />
                Sorry I'm late.
                <br />
                He's a lawyer too?
                <br />
                I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
                All I needed was a briefcase.
                <br />
                Have a great afternoon!
                <br />
                Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
                and I can't get them anywhere.
                <br />
                No problem, Vannie.
                Just leave it to me.
                <br />
                You're a lifesaver, Barry.
                Oan I help who's next?
                <br />
                All right, scramble, jocks!
                It's time to fly.
                <br />
                Thank you, Barry!
                <br />
                That bee is living my life!
                <br />
                Let it go, Kenny.
                <br />
                - When will this nightmare end?!
                - Let it all go.
                <br />
                - Beautiful day to fly.
                - Sure is.
                <br />
                Between you and me,
                I was dying to get out of that office.
                <br />
                You have got
                to start thinking bee, my friend.
                <br />
                - Thinking bee!
                - Me?
                <br />
                Hold it. Let's just stop
                for a second. Hold it.
                <br />
                I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
                Oan we stop here?
                <br />
                I'm not making a major life decision
                during a production number!
                <br />
                All right. Take ten, everybody.
                Wrap it up, guys.
                <br />
                I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
